First and foremost: this assignment shouldn’t be too hard. Seriously. It contains no tricks and you don't need to be a genius to do it.
Basically, you just need to write a simple server and render results on the client side. We don't need you to deploy your app anywhere, 
but obviously you can if you want to. 
Make some assumptions that seem sensible to you -- don't worry if you're not 100% sure -- and write some code we can later talk about.

The assignment aims to give us a glimpse of the decisions you make when you write real-world code. Ideally, the code should be readable, robust and optimal: 
as if it will end up in production.
We recommend you use whatever language you feel strongest in. 
It doesn’t have to be one we use (Javascript) —we believe good developers can be productive in any language.

You may upload your solution to a Github repo and share with us, but feel free to use anything else that is practical.



The task:
-Create a basic app that uses a simple server to fetch a list of posts and renders those posts. 
-The app should also allow you to click on any of the rendered posts and take you to a post detail page, where the user can see the post body.

A few notes that can help you out:
-A sample json of posts you can work with is available on this endpoint: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
-If you'd like, you can write a few basic tests that test your core functionalities.
-As you'll be making a network request, please mind that requests can fail so protect the app against any errors.
